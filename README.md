### INTRODUCTION TO DATA ANALYSIS 
###PROJECT OVERVIEW 
This project aim to generate the insight of what has been learnt over months ago and analyzing the parameter in the data received to gather enough insight which enable us to compile series of tools used in gathering the data.

Data:This is a piece of information gathered from one place or the other. 

Data Generation:This is a collection or capturing of set of data. it impact the data afterward for easy analysis.

Data Set: is a collection of data points.Data point is an aspect of data set. The system is divided into 2.
i.Operational and ii. Analytical System. Data can be stored by two different storage, we have  premises aand cloud. we have 3 different ways which data can be generated we have
+ structure data,
+ semi structure and
+ unstructure data.

Data Analysis is to inject your data to the source or tool use.
  
  ### PROJECT SOURCES 
The primary source of data used is csv, Microsoft Excel, SQL, PowerBI,this is an open source of data and it can be freely downloaded from an open source online.
Data analysis involves inspecting a data cleansing transforming and modeling data to discover useful information draw conclusion and support decisions. Data must be accurate so as to draw conclusion from it.
### Microsoft Excel 
Microsoft Excel [downloaded here][https://www.microsoft.com]

This is done in a tableau format (table) which contains rows and columns. Microsoft Excel is used for data cleaning,  data analyzing and data visualization.
There are different terms used in Excel:
Ribbon interface, Home tabs, commmand up and down bar, quick access tool bar, cell flat file etc
Data entry is what someone has done and you want to enter it.

Cell:- This is horizontal and highlighted green cell and is also called an active cell. it has an address, is called name box. in Excel, tracking your transaction is allowed e.g if you work in a supermarket and you want to track the sales it can be done( product name, name and address of the client, date of transaction) etc.in excel when you highlight all and double click= Autfill
there are 2 ways in which one can type in Excel 1.Text and 2. Number 
+ Text default - Left align
+ Number default - Right align
+ Date in Excel - it depends, Month/Day/Year. in Excel function we have 800-1000 functions (shift f3)
Data set: This is to summarize in 5points e.g Grand total, Highest Salary, lowest salary total number of staff.
Any calculations in Excel:-
It must have equality sign=
sum - summation type sum, press tab[=Sum any info. below are called parameters.Anyone in bold form is the one expecting you to type]

 - ctrl shift left arrow- To select all your number and press Enter key
Name and text - if you are to count column e g count A is used for Name of a person and number count. (Autosum) is used for final results in Excel. we have criteria with conditions in Excel
Example sum for conditional statement= Sumif
Maximum = Maxif
Average = Avif
Minimum = Minif
count = countif
If you are calculating for certain people Sumif, Count if. click on any of the item depending on what you want to do, Right click and sort A- Z. Any operation in bracket is your optional Microsoft Excel is used to clean data, explore and visualize data hidden. it is used to analyze data meaningfully and risk. In Excelwe have conditional functions, they are If,Ifs,AND, Switch,Or,Xor etc, this can be found under logical function.
Transaction Category (you can find them under function Argument) e.g if text < 20 " low" "medium") Enter
 =  Switch = If text < =20 " low", if text < =50) Enter.
##Text cleaning
A tamper sand join text together, if you are using 2 words/ text. There are 3 different cleaning Text:-

### Introduction to SQL
 SQL- structure query language. it is used to store and manage data in a relational data base management. e g Microsoft access MySQL, Oracl SQl Server, PostgreSQL. it enables users to query the database and tables. SQl allowed user to query the database in number of ways using English-like statement.it maintain uniqueness and ensure that your data is consistentence and valid. There are types of keys in SQL 
 i  Primary key - they are special key rhat is uniquely related to tou in a table e.g Staff ID, employee ID,BVN
 ii. Foreign key- A field in one table that is uniquely identified a row of another, creating a relationship between 2tables
